## Quick start

1. Install dependencies by running `pip3 install --target vendor -r requirements.txt` (python3.x). Alternativly set up a python virtual environment.
2. Execute the command: `python3 cps.py` (or `nohup python3 cps.py` - recommended if you want to exit the terminal window)
3. Point your browser to `http://localhost:8083` or `http://localhost:8083/opds` for the OPDS catalog
4. Set `Location of Calibre database` to the path of the folder where your Calibre library (metadata.db) lives, push "submit" button\
   Optionally a Google Drive can be used to host the calibre library [-> Using Google Drive integration](https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web/wiki/Configuration#using-google-drive-integration)
5. Go to Login page

**Default admin login:**\
*Username:* admin\
*Password:* admin123

**Issues with Ubuntu:**
Please note that running the above install command can fail on some versions of Ubuntu, saying `"can't combine user with prefix"`. This is a [known bug](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/3826) and can be remedied by using the command `pip install --system --target vendor -r requirements.txt` instead.

## Requirements

python 3.x+

Optionally, to enable on-the-fly conversion from one ebook format to another when using the send-to-kindle feature, or during editing of ebooks metadata:

[Download and install](https://calibre-ebook.com/download) the Calibre desktop program for your platform and enter the folder including program name (normally /opt/calibre/ebook-convert, or C:\Program Files\calibre\ebook-convert.exe) in the field "calibre's converter tool" on the setup page.

[Download](https://github.com/pgaskin/kepubify/releases/latest) Kepubify tool for your platform and place the binary starting with `kepubify` in Linux: `\opt\kepubify` Windows: `C:\Program Files\kepubify`.

## Docker Images

Pre-built Docker images are available in these Docker Hub repositories:

#### **Technosoft2000 - x64**
+ Docker Hub - [https://hub.docker.com/r/technosoft2000/calibre-web](https://hub.docker.com/r/technosoft2000/calibre-web)
+ Github - [https://github.com/Technosoft2000/docker-calibre-web](https://github.com/Technosoft2000/docker-calibre-web) 

    Includes the Calibre `ebook-convert` binary.
    + The "path to convertertool" should be set to `/opt/calibre/ebook-convert`

#### **LinuxServer - x64, armhf, aarch64**
+ Docker Hub - [https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/calibre-web](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/calibre-web)
+ Github - [https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-calibre-web](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-calibre-web)
+ Github - (Optional Calibre layer) - [https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-calibre-web/tree/calibre](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-calibre-web/tree/calibre) 

   This image has the option to pull in an extra docker manifest layer to include the Calibre `ebook-convert` binary.  Just include the environmental variable `DOCKER_MODS=linuxserver/calibre-web:calibre` in your docker run/docker compose file. **(x64 only)**
  
   If you do not need this functionality then this can be omitted, keeping the image as lightweight as possible.
    
   Both the Calibre-Web and Calibre-Mod images are rebuilt automatically on new releases of Calibre-Web and Calibre respectively, and on updates to any included base image packages on a weekly basis if required.
   + The "path to convertertool" should be set to `/usr/bin/ebook-convert`
   + The "path to unrar" should be set to `/usr/bin/unrar`
